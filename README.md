# MushroomLamp
 
A birthday present for my girlfriend. 

It's a bedside lamp. It features RGB ws2812 led lights and possible iot expansion because of the esp8266 that is used. 

The lamp turns on when the smallest mushroom is pressed. The light is dimmed when the lamp turns on because it's meant to be a bedside lamp that can be usedd in the middle of the night. The brightness can be adjusted by rotating the smallest mushromm. Pressing on the smalllest mushroom cycles the different modes of operation:

1. Static warm light
2. Slow pastel changing colors
3. Shooting stars shower
4. Fire animation 

The lamp is turned off by turning the brightness all the way down.
